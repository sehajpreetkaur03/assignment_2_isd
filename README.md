## Assignment

Assignment A02 builds on Assignment A01 by adding inheritance and polymorphism to the BankAccount system.  
The BankAccount class is extended into ChequingAccount, SavingsAccount, and InvestmentAccount.

Each account type has its own way of calculating service charges while still using the common
features from the superclass such as balance handling, deposits, withdrawals, and validation.

Unit tests were created for each subclass to verify that the service charge calculations and
validation rules work correctly. This helps ensure the system behaves as expected.

The code follows consistent naming, validation, and documentation practices to keep the project
organized, readable, and easy to maintain as future assignments are added.
